Seed project for React apps using Redux


[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/sapientglobalmarkets/react-redux-seed.svg)](https://david-dm.org/sapientglobalmarkets/react-redux-seed)

## Getting started
Create your own project on Github or elsewhere. Then add a git-remote pointing to this repo. Let's name it `redux-seed`. Merge into your own branch.

```shell
> git remote add redux-seed https://github.com/sapientglobalmarkets/react-redux-seed.git
> git pull redux-seed master
> git merge redux-seed/master
```

At this point you should have all the seed files. Now you can run:
```shell
> npm install
```

And you are off to the races!
